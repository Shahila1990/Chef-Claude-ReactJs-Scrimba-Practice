# 👨‍🍳 Chef Claude – AI Recipe Generator

Chef Claude is a fun and interactive AI-powered recipe generator built with ReactJS. Users can input a list of ingredients they have, and Claude will suggest a creative recipe using some or all of those ingredients. This project was inspired by a Scrimba React challenge and extended with real AI functionality using the Hugging Face Inference API.
